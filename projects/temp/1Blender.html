                    <h1>A collection of Blender projects I have worked on in the past</h1>
                    <h2>Why Blender?</h2>
                    <p>I have worked a fair amount in programs like Autodesk Inventor and Fusion 360 
                        for school projects, which represent one side of the spectrum of 3D-modeling programs.  
                        3D modeling exists for multiple purposes of course, but as I found myself interested
                        in improving the well-roundedness of my game development skills, improving my Blender 
                        skills to some extent would be usefull.  <br><br>
                        Autodesk products are far more oriented towards industrial and engineering design as opposed to 
                        creative work.  Not only is the featureset of Blender different than I had used before, 
                        the entire process of creating models was nothing like Autodesk.  Instead of using 
                        constraints to structure carefully dimensioned models, all scaling in Blender is relative,
                        and modifiers are used to apply changes to objects.  <br><br>
                        There are many 3D modeling styles that are widely used, but the Low-Poly style is easier to get
                        started with for someone like me who does not plan to dedicate a ton of time to learning to use
                        Blender.  Low-Poly is well suited for video games in general and in many ways allows for some 
                        stylistic freedom not afforded to other modeling styles.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Simple Dagger and Sword</h2>
                    <p>Basic sword models are created using a variety of shapes.  Multiple methods to make
                        the blade exist, but what I see as the simplest is an extruded hexagon.
